# OmniSci Community Examples

This repository contains example datasets and dashboards known to work well in OmniSci. The intent is to provide a wide range of examples of public datasets across various subject matters and ranges of hardware from laptop to large, data center installations.

## Contributions welcomed!

If you have a public dataset that you've enjoyed using in OmniSci, we welcome contributions for sharing with the community! Submit a pull request with a new folder having a similar structure to the [openstreetmap](https://github.com/omnisci/community_datasets/tree/master/openstreetmap) folder and we'll happily review for content and merge where possible.

The overarching goal is to show how to process data, load data, and visualize data using OmniSci. So examples should whenever possible link to the source data, show what is necessary to pre-process the data, the statements to load the data into OmniSci and a json export of the dashboard(s) built.

If you have an interesting dataset, but are not willing to host it for download, please contact community@omnisci.com and depending on the dataset, we may choose to host it via our S3 account.
